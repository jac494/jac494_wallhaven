# jac494 Wallhaven Scripts

Just toying around with the Wallhaven API and currently working on a script to sync my favorites so that I don't have to keep adding them to favorites and then downloading them. The goal is to just be able to add to my favorites within Wallhaven and know that sometime soon (idk, maybe sync once daily) those favorites will be downloaded to some relevant directory structure.
